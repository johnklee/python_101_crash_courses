    "\n",
    "So you decide to include the flask dependency in a `requirements.txt` file:\n",
    "```\n",
    "flask\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Great, everything works fine locally, and after hacking away on your app for a while, you decide to move it to production. Here’s where things get a little scary…\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>The above `requirements.txt` file doesn’t specify which version of flask to use</b>. In this case, <font color='blue'>pip install -r requirements.txt</font> will install the latest version by default. This is okay unless there are interface or behavior changes in the newest version that break our application.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of this example, let’s say that <b><font color='darkred'>a new version of flask got released. However, it isn’t backward compatible with the version you used during development</font></b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let’s say you deploy your application to production and do a <font color='blue'>pip install -r requirements.txt</font>. Pip gets the latest, <b>not-backward-compatible version of flask, and just like that, your application breaks… in production</b>.\n",
    "> “But hey, it worked on my machine!”—I’ve been there myself, and it’s not a great feeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>At this point, you know that the version of flask you used during development worked fine</b>. So, to fix things, you try to be a little more specific in your `requirements.txt`. <b>You add a version specifier to the flask dependency. This is also called pinning a dependency</b>:\n",
    "```\n",
    "flask==0.12.1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Pinning the flask dependency to a specific version ensures that a <font color='blue'>pip install -r requirements.txt</font> sets up the exact version of `flask` you used during development. But does it really?\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Keep in mind that flask itself has dependencies as well</b> (which pip installs automatically). However, <b>flask itself doesn’t specify exact versions for its dependencies. For example, it allows any version of `Werkzeug>=0.14`</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, for the sake of this example, let’s say a new version of Werkzeug got released, but it introduces a show-stopper bug to your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you do <font color='blue'>pip install -r requirements.txt</font> in production this time, you will get `flask==0.12.1` since you’ve pinned that requirement. However, unfortunately, you’ll get the latest, buggy version of Werkzeug. Again, the product breaks in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b><font size='3ptx'>The real issue here is that the build isn’t deterministic</font></b>. What I mean by that is that, given the same input (<font color='brown'>the `requirements.txt` file</font>), pip doesn’t always produce the same environment. At the moment, <b>you can’t easily replicate the exact environment you have on your development machine in production</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>The typical solution to this problem is to use <font color='blue'>pip freeze</font>. This command allows you to get exact versions for all 3rd party libraries currently installed, including the sub-dependencies pip installed automatically</b>. So you can freeze everything in development to ensure that you have the same environment in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "Executing pip freeze results in pinned dependencies you can add to a `requirements.txt`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "click==6.7\n",
    "Flask==0.12.1\n",
    "itsdangerous==0.24\n",
    "Jinja2==2.10\n",
    "MarkupSafe==1.0\n",
    "Werkzeug==0.14.1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With these pinned dependencies, you can ensure that the packages installed in your production environment match those in your development environment exactly, so your product doesn’t unexpectedly break. <b>This “solution,” unfortunately, leads to a whole new set of problems</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that <b>you’ve specified the exact versions of every third-party package, you are responsible for keeping these versions up to date, even though they’re sub-dependencies of `flask`</b>. What if there’s a security hole discovered in `Werkzeug==0.14.1` that the package maintainers immediately patched in `Werkzeug==0.14.2`? You really need to update to `Werkzeug==0.14.2` to avoid any security issues arising from the earlier, unpatched version of `Werkzeug`.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you need to be aware that there’s an issue with the version you have. Then, you need to get the new version in your production environment before someone exploits the security hole. So, you have to change your `requirements.txt` manually to specify the new version `Werkzeug==0.14.2`. As you can see in this situation, the responsibility of staying up to date with necessary updates falls on you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The truth is that you really don’t care what version of Werkzeug gets installed as long as it doesn’t break your code. In fact, you probably want the latest version to ensure that you’re getting bug fixes, security patches, new features, more optimization, and so on.\n",

    "### <b><font color='darkgreen'>Dependency Resolution</font></b>\n",
    "What do I mean by dependency resolution? Let’s say you’ve got a requirements.txt file that looks something like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "package_a\n",
    "package_b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say `package_a` has a sub-dependency `package_c`, and `package_a` requires a specific version of this package: `package_c>=1.0`. In turn, `package_b` has the same sub-dependency but needs `package_c<=2.0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, when you try to install `package_a` and `package_b`, the installation tool would look at the requirements for `package_c` (<font color='brown'>being >=1.0 and <=2.0</font>) and select a version that fulfills those requirements. <b>You’d hope that the tool resolves the dependencies so that your program works in the end. This is what I mean by “dependency resolution.”</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, pip itself doesn’t have real dependency resolution at the moment, but there’s an [open issue](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/988) to support it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way pip would handle the above scenario is as follows:\n",
    "1. It installs `package_a` and looks for a version of `package_c` that fulfills the first requirement (`package_c>=1.0`).\n",
    "2. Pip then installs the latest version of `package_c` to fulfill that requirement. Let’s say the latest version of `package_c` is 3.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the trouble (potentially) starts. If the version of `package_c` selected by pip doesn’t fit future requirements (such as `package_b` needing `package_c<=2.0`), the installation will fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>The “solution” to this problem is to specify the range required for the sub-dependency</b> (`package_c`) <b>in the `requirements.txt` file</b>. That way, pip can resolve this conflict and install a package that meets those requirements:\n",
    "```\n",
    "package_c>=1.0,<=2.0\n",
    "package_a\n",
    "package_b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like before though, you’re now concerning yourself directly with sub-dependencies (`package_c`). The issue with this is that if `package_a` changes their requirement without you knowing, the requirements you specified (`package_c>=1.0,<=2.0`) may no longer be acceptable, and installation may fail… again. <b>The real problem is that once again, you’re responsible for staying up to date with requirements of sub-dependencies</b>.\n",
