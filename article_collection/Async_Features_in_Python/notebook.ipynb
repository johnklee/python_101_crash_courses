    "A **synchronous program** is executed one step at a time. Even with conditional branching, loops and function calls, you can still think about the code in terms of taking one execution step at a time. When each step is complete, the program moves on to the next one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are two examples of programs that work this way:\n",
    "* **Batch processing programs** are often created as synchronous programs. You get some input, process it, and create some output. Steps follow one after the other until the program reaches the desired output. The program only needs to pay attention to the steps and their order.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Command-line programs** are small, quick processes that run in a terminal. These scripts are used to create something, transform one thing into something else, generate a report, or perhaps list out some data. This can be expressed as a series of program steps that are executed sequentially until the program is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **asynchronous program** behaves differently. It still takes one execution step at a time. The difference is that the system may not wait for an execution step to be completed before moving on to the next one.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the program will move on to future execution steps even though a previous step hasn’t yet finished and is still running elsewhere. This also means that the program knows what to do when a previous step does finish running.\n",

    "When you start trying to understand asynchronous programming, you might see a lot of discussion about the importance of blocking, or writing [non-blocking code](https://medium.com/vaidikkapoor/understanding-non-blocking-i-o-with-python-part-1-ec31a2e2db9b). (<font color='brown'>Personally, I struggled to get a good grasp of these concepts from the people I asked and the documentation I read.</font>)\n",
    "\n",
    "What is non-blocking code? What’s blocking code, for that matter? Would the answers to these questions help you write a better web server? If so, how could you do it? Let’s find out!\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Writing asynchronous programs requires that you think differently about programming</b>. While this new way of thinking can be hard to wrap your head around, it’s also an interesting exercise. That’s because the real world is almost entirely asynchronous, and so is how you interact with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine this: you’re a parent trying to do several things at once. You have to balance the checkbook, do the laundry, and keep an eye on the kids. Somehow, you’re able to do all of these things at the same time without even thinking about it! Let’s break it down:\n",
    "* Balancing the checkbook is a **synchronous** task. One step follows another until it’s done. You’re doing all the work yourself.\n",
    "* However, you can break away from the checkbook to do laundry. You unload the dryer, move clothes from the washer to the dryer, and start another load in the washer.\n",
    "* Working with the washer and dryer is a <b>synchronous</b> task, but the bulk of the work happens after the washer and dryer are started. Once you’ve got them going, you can walk away and get back to the checkbook task. At this point, the washer and dryer tasks have become <b>asynchronous</b>. The washer and dryer will run independently until the buzzer goes off (<font color='brown'>notifying you that the task needs attention</font>).\n",
    "* Watching your kids is another <b>asynchronous</b> task. Once they are set up and playing, they can do so independently for the most part. This changes when someone needs attention, like when someone gets hungry or hurt. When one of your kids yells in alarm, you react. The kids are a long-running task with high priority. Watching them supersedes any other tasks you might be doing, like the checkbook or laundry.\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples can help to illustrate the concepts of blocking and non-blocking code. Let’s think about this in programming terms. In this example, you’re like the CPU. While you’re moving the laundry around, you (the CPU) are busy and blocked from doing other work, like balancing the checkbook. But that’s okay because the task is relatively quick.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, starting the washer and dryer does not block you from performing other tasks. It’s an asynchronous function because you don’t have to wait for it to finish. Once it’s started, you can go back to something else. This is called a context switch: the context of what you’re doing has changed, and the machine’s buzzer will notify you sometime in the future when the laundry task is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>As a human, this is how you work all the time. You naturally juggle multiple things at once, often without thinking about it. As a developer, the trick is how to translate this kind of behavior into code that does the same kind of thing.</b>"

If not, then the parent can go back to work on the checkbook. However, if any of those tasks do need attention, then the parent will take care of it before going back to the checkbook. This cycle continues on until the next timeout out of the polling loop.\n",

    "This approach works as well since multiple tasks are getting attention. However, there are a couple of problems:\n",
    "1. **The parent may spend a lot of time checking on things that don’t need attention**: The washer and dryer haven’t yet finished, and the kids don’t need any attention unless something unexpected happens.\n",
    "2. **The parent may miss completed tasks that do need attention**: For instance, if the washer finished its cycle at the beginning of the polling interval, then it wouldn’t get any attention for up to fifteen minutes! What’s more, watching the kids is supposedly the highest priority task. They couldn’t tolerate fifteen minutes with no attention when something might be going drastically wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could address these issues by shortening the polling interval, but now your parent (the CPU) would be spending more time context switching between tasks.

    "“If I could only clone myself…” If you’re a parent, then you’ve probably had similar thoughts! Since you’re programming virtual parents, you can essentially do this by using threading. This is a mechanism that allows multiple sections of one program to run at the same time. <b>Each section of code that runs independently is known as a thread, and all threads share the same memory space</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you think of each task as a part of one program, then you can separate them and run them as threads. In other words, you can “clone” the parent, creating one instance for each task: watching the kids, monitoring the washer, monitoring the dryer, and balancing the checkbook. All of these “clones” are running independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sounds like a pretty nice solution, but there are some issues here as well. One is that you’ll have to explicitly tell each parent instance what to do in your program. This can lead to some problems since all instances share everything in the program space.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say that Parent A is monitoring the dryer. Parent A sees that the clothes are dry, so they take control of the dryer and begin unloading the clothes. At the same time, Parent B sees that the washer is done, so they take control of the washer and begin removing clothes. However, Parent B also needs to take control of the dryer so they can put the wet clothes inside. This can’t happen, because Parent A currently has control of the dryer.\n",

They’ll wait forever for the other parent instance to release control. As the programmer, you’d have to write code to work this situation out.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b><font color='darkred'>Note.</font></b>\n",
    "> Threaded programs allow you to create multiple, parallel paths of execution that all share the same memory space. This is both an advantage and a disadvantage. Any memory shared between threads is subject to one or more threads trying to use the same shared memory at the same time. This can lead to data corruption, data read in an invalid state, and data that’s just messy in general.\n",
    "> <br/><br/>\n",
    "> In threaded programming, the context switch happens under system control, not the programmer. The system controls when to switch contexts and when to give threads access to shared data, thereby changing the context of how the memory is being used. All of these kinds of problems are manageable in threaded code, but it’s difficult to get right, and hard to debug when it’s wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s another issue that might arise from threading. Suppose that a child gets hurt and needs to be taken to urgent care. Parent C has been assigned the task of watching over the kids, so they take the child right away. At the urgent care, Parent C needs to write a fairly large check to cover the cost of seeing the doctor.\n",

    "Meanwhile, Parent D is at home working on the checkbook. They’re unaware of this large check being written, so they’re very surprised when the family checking account is suddenly overdrawn!\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, these two parent instances are working within the same program. The family checking account is a shared resource, so you’d have to work out a way for the child-watching parent to inform the checkbook-balancing parent. Otherwise, you’d need to provide some kind of locking mechanism so that the checkbook resource can only be used by one parent at a time, with updates."

The change to <font color='blue'>task()</font> defines it as asynchronous with the addition of the `async` prefix on line 4. This indicates to Python that the function will be asynchronous.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other big change is removing the <font color='blue'>time.sleep(delay)</font> and `yield` statements, and replacing them with <font color='blue'>await asyncio.sleep(delay)</font>. This creates a non-blocking delay that will perform a context switch back to the caller <font color='blue'>main()</font>.\n",

When the `await` keyword is reached, a context switch occurs, and control passes back to the event loop. The event loop looks at all the tasks waiting for an event (<font color='brown'>in this case, an</font> <font color='blue'>asyncio.sleep(delay)</font> <font color='brown'>timeout</font>) and passes control to a task with an event that’s ready.\n",

Instead of waiting for the delay to timeout, the CPU registers a sleep event on the event loop task queue and performs a context switch by passing control to the event loop.** The event loop continuously looks for completed events and passes control back to the task waiting for that event. In this way, the CPU can stay busy if work is available, while the event loop monitors the events that will happen in the future.\n",
