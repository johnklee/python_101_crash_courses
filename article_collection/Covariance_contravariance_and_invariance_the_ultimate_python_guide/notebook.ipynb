    "So dogs list of the type `List[Dog]` got an object that cannot bark — a <b><font color='blue'>Kangaroo</font></b>. That’s why you cannot safely use object of `List[Dog]` type whenever there is an object of the type `List[Animal]` expected. Therefore `List[Dog]` is not a subtype of `List[Animal]`. Remember: the type is defined not only by a set of objects but also by functions/methods that can be used with these objects.\n",

    "Other invariant types are `Set`, `Dict`, and many more mutable containers. I think it is pretty obvious now and no further examples are needed. This feature of immutable containers is clearly advantageous over mutable ones. But that’s another story for another time…\n",

    "In more general terms, any structure that supports both read and write operations on some set of objects — mutable container, queue, stack, heap, router, etc. — is invariant in the type of the objects it operates on."

    "## <font color='darkblue'>Bonus: Liskov Substitution Principle</font>\n",
    "In this blog post series, I frequently said something like **it’s type-safe to use an object of the `SubType` type where an object of the `SuperType` type is expected**. This assumption is based on Liskov Substitution Principle — the principle formulated by Barbara Liskov, an American computer scientist. Wikipedia states it as follows:\n",
    "> `[…]` if `S` is a subtype of `T`, then objects of type `T` may be replaced with objects of type `S` (<font color='brown'>i.e. an object of type `T` may be substituted with any object of a subtype `S`</font>) without altering any of the desirable properties of the program (correctness, task performed, etc.). [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a pretty strong requirement — when I replace any object of `SuperType` with an object of `SubType` (<font color='brown'>where `SubType <: SuperType`</font>) my program still needs to function correctly. It means not only that it cannot raise any new exceptions, but also it still needs to work according to its (<font color='brown'>original</font>) specification. This even means that we cannot override methods in subclasses if it changes the original behaviour; we can only add new methods. Python type system is not so rigid and [**mypy**](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) won’t complain when we override a method and change its behaviour (<font color='brown'>both methods— overridden and overriding — still need to have the same argument types, though!</font>). Yet, it’s good to know how to write even safer code"
