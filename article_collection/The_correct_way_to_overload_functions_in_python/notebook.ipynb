    "\n",
    "<b>This approach is called <font color='darkblue'>Multiple Dispatch</font> or <font color='darkblue'>multimethods</font>, where the interpreter differentiates between multiple implementations of a function/method at runtime based on dynamically determined types.</b> To be more precise, the language uses types of arguments passed to a function during its invocation to dynamically choose which one of the multiple function implementations to use (<font color='brown'>or dispatch</font>).\n",

If it can't be implemented normally, maybe we shouldn't use it in Python...\" Yea, valid point, but <b>there are good reasons to want to implement some form of function/method overloading in Python. It's powerful tool that can make code more concise, readable and minimise its complexity</b>. Without multimethods though, the \"obvious way\" to do this is using type inspection with <a href='https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#isinstance'>isinstance()</a>. This is very ugly, brittle solution that is closed to extension and I would call it an anti-pattern.\n",

Each of them is also decorated with <b><font color='orange'>@format.register</font></b> which attaches them to the previously mentioned format function.
