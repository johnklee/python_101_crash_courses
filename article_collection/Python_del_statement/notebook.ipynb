    "<font size='3ptx'>Python has a [**garbage collection system**](https://realpython.com/python-memory-management/#garbage-collection) that takes care of removing unused objects from memory and freeing up resources for later use. In Python’s [CPython](https://realpython.com/cpython-source-code-guide/) implementation, the <b><font color='darkblue'>reference count</font></b> is the primary indicator that triggers garbage collection.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, Python keeps track of how many identifiers hold references to each object at any given time. The number of identifiers pointing to a given object is known as the object’s <b><font color='darkblue'>reference count</font></b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there’s at least one active reference to an object, then the object will remain accessible to you, occupying memory on your computer. If you use `del` to remove this single reference, then the object is ready for garbage collection, which will remove the object and free the memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if you have several active references to an object and you use `del` to remove some of these references but not all of them, then the garbage collection system won’t be able to remove the object and free up the memory.\n",

    "In short, del removes references, while garbage collection removes objects and frees up memory. According to this behavior, you can <b>conclude that `del` only allows you to reduce your code’s memory consumption when it removes the last reference to an object, which prepares the object to be garbage-collected</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s important to note that Python’s garbage collection system doesn’t free the memory used by an object immediately after you remove the last reference to that object, bringing the reference count down to zero. Instead, <b>Python’s garbage collector periodically scans the memory for unreferenced objects and frees them</b>.\n",
    "> <font color='orange'><b>Note:</b></font> The del statement isn’t the only tool that you can use to lower the reference count of a given object. If you make an existing reference point to another object, then you implicitly remove one reference to the original object.\n",
    "> Another action that lowers the reference count is making a given reference go out of scope, implicitly removing the reference.\n",
