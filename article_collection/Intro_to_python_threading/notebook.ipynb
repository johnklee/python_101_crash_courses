    "\n",
    "It’s tempting to think of threading as having two (<font color='brown'>or more</font>) different processors running on your program, each one doing an independent task at the same time. That’s almost right. <b><font color='darkred'>The threads may be running on different processors, but they will only be running one at a time</font></b>.\n",

    "Because of the way CPython implementation of Python works, threading may not speed up all tasks. This is due to interactions with the [**GIL**](https://realpython.com/python-gil/) that essentially limit one Python thread to run at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Tasks that spend much of their time waiting for external events are generally good candidates for threading</b>. Problems that require heavy CPU computation and spend little time waiting for external events might not run faster at all.\n",

If you are running on a different Python implementation, check with the documentation too see how it handles threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>If you are running a standard Python implementation, writing in only Python, and have a CPU-bound problem, you should check out the [multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html) module instead</b>.\n",

    "<b>Architecting your program to use threading can also provide gains in design clarity.

The most common way to do this is called `Lock` in Python. In some other languages this same idea is called a mutex. Mutex comes from MUTual EXclusion, which is exactly what a Lock does.\n",
    "\n",

    "The basic functions to do this are [.acquire()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#threading.Lock.acquire) and [.release()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#threading.Lock.release). A thread will call `my_lock.acquire()` to get the lock. If the lock is already held, the calling thread will wait until it is released. There’s an important point here. If one thread gets the lock but never gives it back, your program will be stuck. You’ll read more about this later.\n",

    "Making sure the queue is empty before the consumer finishes prevents another fun issue. If the consumer does exit while the pipeline has messages in it, there are two bad things that can happen.
