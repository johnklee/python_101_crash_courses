    "<b><font size='3ptx'>A thread is a separate flow of execution. This means that your program will have two things happening at once. But for most Python 3 implementations the different threads do not actually execute at the same time: they merely appear to.</font></b>\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s tempting to think of threading as having two (<font color='brown'>or more</font>) different processors running on your program, each one doing an independent task at the same time. That’s almost right. <b><font color='darkred'>The threads may be running on different processors, but they will only be running one at a time</font></b>.\n",

    "\n",
    "Because of the way CPython implementation of Python works, threading may not speed up all tasks. This is due to interactions with the [**GIL**](https://realpython.com/python-gil/) that essentially limit one Python thread to run at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Tasks that spend much of their time waiting for external events are generally good candidates for threading</b>. Problems that require heavy CPU computation and spend little time waiting for external events might not run faster at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>This is true for code written in Python and running on the standard CPython implementation</b>. If your threads are written in C they have the ability to release the GIL and run concurrently. If you are running on a different Python implementation, check with the documentation too see how it handles threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>If you are running a standard Python implementation, writing in only Python, and have a CPU-bound problem, you should check out the [multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html) module instead</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Architecting your program to use threading can also provide gains in design clarity. Most of the examples you’ll learn about in this tutorial are not necessarily going to run faster because they use threads</b>. Using threading in them helps to make the design cleaner and easier to reason about.\n",

    "## <font color='darkblue'>Race Conditions</font> ([back](#sect0))\n",
    "<b><font size='3ptx'>Before you move on to some of the other features tucked away in Python threading, let’s talk a bit about one of the more difficult issues you’ll run into when writing threaded programs: [race conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition).</font></b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you’ve seen what a race condition is and looked at one happening, you’ll move on to some of the primitives provided by the standard library to prevent race conditions from happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Race conditions can occur when two or more threads access a shared piece of data or resource. In this example, you’re going to create a large race condition that happens every time, but be aware that <b>most race conditions are not this obvious. Frequently, they only occur rarely, and they can produce confusing results. As you can imagine, this makes them quite difficult to debug</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, this race condition will happen every time, and you’ll walk through it in detail to explain what is happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, you’re going to write a class that updates a database. Okay, you’re not really going to have a database: you’re just going to fake it, because that’s not the point of this article.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your <b><font color='blue'>FakeDatabase</font></b> will have <font color='blue'>.\\_\\_init__()</font> and <font color='blue'>.update()</font> methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class FakeDatabase:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.value = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "    def update(self, name):\n",
    "        logging.info(\"Thread %s: starting update\", name)\n",
    "        local_copy = self.value\n",
    "        local_copy += 1\n",
    "        time.sleep(0.1)\n",
    "        self.value = local_copy\n",
    "        logging.info(\"Thread %s: finishing update\", name)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "FakeDatabase is keeping track of a single number: `.value`. This is going to be the shared data on which you’ll see the race condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, reading from the database just means copying `.value` to a local variable. The computation is just to add one to the value and then <font color='blue'>.sleep()</font> for a little bit. Finally, it writes the value back by copying the local value back to `.value`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how you’ll use this <b><font color='blue'>FakeDatabase</font></b>:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    database = FakeDatabase()\n",
    "    logging.info(\"Testing update. Starting value is %d.\", database.value)\n",
    "    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=2) as executor:\n",
    "        for index in range(2):\n",
    "            executor.submit(database.update, index)\n",
    "    logging.info(\"Testing update. Ending value is %d.\", database.value)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The program creates a [**ThreadPoolExecutor**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#threadpoolexecutor) with two threads and then calls <font color='blue'>.submit()</font> on each of them, telling them to run <font color='blue'>database.update()</font>.\n",
    "\n",
    "[.submit()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.Executor.submit) has a signature that allows both positional and named arguments to be passed to the function running in the thread. In the usage above, index is passed as the first and only positional argument to <font color='blue'>database.update()</font>. You’ll see later in this article where you can pass multiple arguments in a similar manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since each thread runs <font color='blue'>.update()</font>, and <font color='blue'>.update()</font> adds one to .value, you might expect `database.value` to be 2 when it’s printed out at the end. But you wouldn’t be looking at this example if that was the case. If you run the above code, the output looks like this:"
